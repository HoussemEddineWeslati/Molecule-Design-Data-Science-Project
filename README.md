# bioactivity prediction and molecule generation app
### Generating the models.

The machine learning model used in this web app will firstly have to be generated by successfully running the included [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/HoussemEddineWeslati/Molecule-Design-Data-Science-Project/tree/main/3%20Targets%20Notebooks). Upon successfully running all code cells,the predictions models will be generated all you need to do is to put the saved  models files in the Streamlit app folder .

###  Launch the app

```
streamlit run app.py
```
